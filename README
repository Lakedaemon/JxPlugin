The "Expression" field must not contain anything other than 1 word (i.e. no space, no tabs, no exemple, no html, etc...)

-> your Kanji inside a "custom" card model : 
Fields : "Kanji", the others fields don't matter

Cards templates : "Kanji ?"

The "Kanji" field must not contain anything other than 1 Kanji (i.e. no space, no tab, no exemple, no html, etc...)
